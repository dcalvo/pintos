struct shared_info
  {
    tid_t tid;                      /* Thread identifier. */
    bool is_being_waited_upon;      /* Is there a thread already waiting on this one? */
    bool has_exited;                /* If thread has exited. */
    int exit_code;                  /* Integer representing how the process exited. */
    struct list_elem elem;          /* List element. */
  };

Shared_info is like a process control block. It houses some information about the thread
that both it and its parent should share.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

Argument parsing is done using strtok_r. We tokenize the command line string and store the
arguments and number of arguments. When it comes time to load the executable, we start at
the top of the stack and push those arguments downward. We decrement the stack pointer after
each operation by the appropriate type size in order to maintain a valid stack. 

The stack page can only be overflowed if we attempt to give it a limitless input of arguments
to push onto the stack. Since we limit user input to the size of one page, we should have ample
room to store the maximum of one page of arguments onto the stack. 

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

I would assume that Pintos uses strtok_r() and not strtok() because the former is thread-safe 
while the latter is not. Since strtok_r() uses a save_ptr, a thread can call the function but
then be blocked safely. If a thread instead used strtok(), when it becomes blocked, other threads
that call the function could modify its stored strtok() data. This violates the exclusiveness of
a thread's memory.

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this

The first advantage is security. Anything that the user can input and have parsed by the kernel
is an inherent security vulnerability. It allows buffer overflow and stack smashing attacks, which
if successful, grants access to the kernel and effectively the entire system.

The second advantage is customization. Since Unix-like systems has the shell do command parsing,
there is a degree of customization inherent to the choice. You can use sh, bash, zsh, or any other
numerous shells, which parse commands differently (and perhaps more sensibly to you). If the kernel
did this parsing, then there would be no way to modify the parsing without modifying the kernel (a
very extreme measure for such minor customization).

Currently, the check for accessing user memory occurs on every requested byte. 
So for a full page of 4,096 bytes, we pagedir_get_page() 4,096 times. This
can very likely be reduced down to a fraction if we scale the number of times
we check a byte. We can make it a constant number and simply check at those
divisional markers. So, if we wanted to check 4 times per call, we would check
at 1,024, 2,048, etc. We would simply run the risk of having intermediate memory
be invalid and go unchecked, requiring another system of failing safely.

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.
Wait is quite simple and could probably be improved. When a parent waits on a created child,
it waits for the child's exiting status to be updated. So the parent enters wait and enters
an infinite while loop dependent on the child's exit status. When the child terminates,
the child's status is updated. On the next schedule of the waiting parent thread, it will
re-evaluate the while loop condition and move past the block.

The issue described is really minimal if you're diligent about developing your code piecemeal.
All of our syscalls use a fetch_args function, which has very simple syntax and also validates
the arguments of itself. It does this by handing the arguments to another validate_addr function.
validate_addr has no return type and is called before any memory access. By this system, we can
reduce what would normally be 1-4 blocks of error handling per system call, and turn it into two
function calls that are very obvious in their purpose. This ensures that when looking at a syscall
implementation, you're reading exactly what the syscall does and not getting distracted by input
validation.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.
